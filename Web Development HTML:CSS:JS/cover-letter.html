        <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>

        <p>
          I am writing to express my interest in any <strong>Information Technology
          </strong> or <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> opportunities. I am currently
           pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at <em>Western 
           Governors University</em> and have professional experience supporting
          enterprise environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role as a <strong>Data Center Technician II</strong>, I support
          critical infrastructure by troubleshooting hardware issues, following operational
          procedures, and collaborating with multiple teams to maintain reliability and uptime.
          I also serve in a <strong>Cyber Defense</strong> role with the <em>USAF Reserves</em>,
          where I continue to strengthen my understanding of security best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am known for being dependable, detail-oriented, and committed to continuous improvement.
          I take pride in applying structured problem-solving and communicating clearly.
          I am especially interested in roles where I can contribute to
          <mark>protecting systems, reducing risk, and improving security posture</mark>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss
          how my background and motivation align with your organization’s needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br />
          <strong>Sherman Purnell</strong>
